        <p><b>Questions 1-11</b></p>
        <p>The time when humans crossed the Artic land bridge from Siberia to Alaska seems remote to us today, but actually represents a late stage in the prehistory of humans, an era when polished stone <b>implements</b> and bows and arrows were already being used, and dogs had already been domesticated.</p>
        <p>When <b>these early migrants</b> arrived in North America, they found the woods and plains dominated by three types of American mammoths. These elephants were distinguished from today’s elephants mainly by their thick, shaggy coats and their huge, upward-curving tusks. They had arrived on the continent hundreds of thousands of years before their human followers. The wooly mammoth in the North, the Columbian mammoth in middle North America, and the imperial mammoth of the South, together with their distant cousins the mastodons, dominated the land. Here, as in the old word, there is evidence that humans hunted these elephants, as shown by the numerous spear points found with mammoth <b>remains</b>.</p>
        <p>Then, at the end of the Ice Age, when the last glaciers had retreated, there was a relatively sudden and widespread extinction of elephants. In the New Word, both mammoths and mastodons disappeared. In the old Word, only Indian and African elephants survived.</p>
        <p>Why did the huge, <b>seemingly</b> successful mammoths disappear?</p>
        <p>Were humans connected with their extinction? Perhaps, but at the time, although they were <b>cunning</b> hunters, humans were still widely scattered and not very numerous. It is difficult to see how they could have prevailed over the mammoth to such an extent.</p>

        <p><b>Questions 12-23</b></p>
        <p>Just before and during World War l, a number of white musicians came to Chicago from New Orleans playing in an <b>idiom</b> they had learning from blacks in that city. Five of them formed what eventually became known as the Original Dixieland Band. They moved to New York in 1917 and won fame there. That year they recorded the first phonograph record identified as jazz.</p>
        <p>The first important recording by black musicians was made in Chicago in 1923 by King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, a group that including trumpet player Louis Armstrong. Armstrong’s dynamic trumpet style became famous worldwide. Other band members had played in fate Marable’s band, which traveled up and down the Mississippi River entertaining passengers on riverboats.</p>
        <p>The characteristics of this early type of jazz, known as Dixieland jazz, included a complex interweaving of melodic lines among the cornet our trumpet, clarinet and trombone and a <b>steady</b> chomp-chomp beat provided by the rhythm section, which included the piano, bass and drums. Most bands used no written notations, preferring arrangements, permitted them plenty to freedom to improvise when playing solos.</p>
        <p>In the late 1920’s, the most influential jazz artists in Chicago were members of small bands such as the Wolverines. In New York, the trend was toward large groups. These groups played in revues, large dance halls and theaters. Bands would become larger still during the next age of jazz, the swing era.</p>

        <p><b>Questions 24-32</b></p>
        <p>A pioneering study by Donald Appleyard made the <b>astounding</b> discovery that a sudden increase in the volume of traffic through an area affects people in the way that a sudden increase in crime does. Appleyard observed this by finding three blocks of houses middle-class and working-class residents, with approximately the ran down Octavia Street (LIGHT street, in Appleyard’s terminology) while Gough Street (MEDIUM street) was used by 8,000 cars daily, and Franklin Street often had as many cars in an hour as Octavia Street had in a day.</p>
        <p>Heavy traffic brought with it danger, noise, fumes, and soot directly, and trash secondarily. That is, the cars didn’t bring in much trash, but when trash accumulated, residents seldom picked it up. The cars, Appleyard determined, reduced the amount of territory residents felt responsible for. Noise was a constant intrusion into their homes. Many Franklin Street residents covered their doors and windows and spent most of their time in the rear of their houses. Most families with children had already left.</p>
        <p>Conditions on Octavia Street were much different. Residents picked up trash. They sat on their front steps and <b>chatted</b> with as many acquaintances as the people on Franklin.</p>
        <p>On Gough Street, residents said that the old feeling of community was disappearing as traffic increased. People were number of families had recently moved, and more were considering it. Those who were staying expressed deep regret at the destruction of their community.</p>

        <p><b>Questions 33-42</b></p>
        <p>Rachel Carson was born in 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She studied biology at college, and zoology at Johnns Hopkins University, where she received her master’s degree in 1933. In 1936, she was hired by the U.S Fish and Wildlife service, where she worked most of her life.</p>
        <p>Carson’s first book, <i>Under the Sea Wind</i>, was published in 1941. It received excellent reviews, but sales were poor until it was reissued in 1952. In that year she published <i>The Sea Around Us</i>, which provided a fascinating look beneath the ocean’s surface, emphasizing human history as well as geology and marine biology. Her imagery and language had a poetic quality. Carson consulted no fewer than 1,000 printed sources. She had voluminous correspondence and frequent discussion with experts in the field. However, she always realized the limitations of her non-technical readers.</p>
        <p>In 1962 Carson published <i>Silent Spring</i>, a book that sparked considerable controversy. It proved how much harm was done by the uncontrolled, <b>reckless</b> use of insecticides. She detailed how they poison the food. At the time, spokesmen for the chemical industry mounted personal attacks against Carson and issued propaganda to indicate that her findings were <b>flawed</b>. However, her work was vindicated by a 1963 report of the President’s Science Advisory Committee.</p>

        <p><b>Questions 43-50</b></p>
        <p>What is meant by the term &quot;economic resources&quot;? In general, these are all the natural, man-made, and human resources that go into the production of goods and services. <b>This obviously covers a lot of ground</b>: factories and farms, tools and machines, transportation and communication facilities, all types of natural resources and labor. Economic resources can be broken down into two general categories; property resources-land and capital-and human resources-labor and entrepreneurial skills.</p>
        <p>What do economists mean by &quot;land&quot;? Much more than the non-economist. Land refers to all natural resources that are usable in the production process: <b>arable</b> land, forests, mineral and oil deposits, and so on. What about capital? Capital goods are all the man-made aids to producing storing, transporting, and distributing goods and services. Capital goods differ from consumer goods in that <b>the latter</b> satisfy wants directly, while the former does so indirectly by facilitating the production of consumer good.it should be noted that capital as defined here does not refer to money. Money as such produces nothing</p>
        <p>The term labor refers to the physical and mental talents of humans used to produce goods or services (with the exception of a certain set of human talents, entrepreneurial skills, which will be considered separately because of their special significance)</p>
        <p>Thus, the services of a factory worker or an office worker, a ballet dancer or an astronaut all fall under the general <b>heading</b> of labor.</p>
